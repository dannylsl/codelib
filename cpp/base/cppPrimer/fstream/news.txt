SHINGTON â€” The U.S. military, along with Arab allies, launched the first
airstrikes against Islamic State targets in Syria late Monday, as the war
ordered by President Obama against the militant organization took on an urgent
new phase.

The Pentagon acknowledged responsibility for the attack on the group, also
known as ISIL and ISIS, in a brief statement.

"I can confirm that U.S. military and partner nation forces are undertaking
military action against ISIL terrorists in Syria using a mix of fighter, bomber
and Tomahawk Land Attack Missiles," said Rear Adm. John Kirby, the Pentagon
press secretary. "Given that these operations are ongoing, we are not in a
position to provide additional details at this time."
