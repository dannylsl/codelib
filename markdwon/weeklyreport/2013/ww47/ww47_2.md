### TO DO PROGRESS
	> [WEEKLY WORK]
		> build new libs for ww47 [AwesomePlayer.cpp | SensorSevice.cpp | Vpp_SETTING ]
			[STATE-DONE]

			[STATE-ON GOING] Most cases return Okay except stream_chrome & stream_stock
				* The com.android.settings crashed after I push the old wpa_supplicant.conf file to
					the device. Since the wpa_supplicant.conf has changed from Android 4.4(Kitkat)

				* The stream cases is going to be re-measured tomorrow 2013-11-26
					[STATE - DONE]
					The reason why the com.Android.settings crashed is that the post_flash.sh
					shell-scirpt remove the NFC, without which the com.Android.settings crashed
