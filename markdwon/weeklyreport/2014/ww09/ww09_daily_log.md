MOORE FIELD PRH can not lanuch camera, always prompt "Can not connect to Camera"
Thanks for Yinpu's help that finding the camera is bad and change an same camera get from
an PR2

FIND THE REASON. WHY MOOREFIELD ALWAYS POWERED OFF AUTOMATICALLY
    Voltage 3.8 from monsoon is too lower to support MOOREFLD to launch more application
    set voltage to 4.2

* Do the most the cases and power measurement
* Feng Wei from Shanghai need auto-vpnp support.
    -> Simplified the auto-vpnp to support Baytrail in half-auto mode

Use codeIgniter and tablecloth to create tables to show the data of MOOREFLD result
