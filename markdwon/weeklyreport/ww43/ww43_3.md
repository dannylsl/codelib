================================
### FFRD PR2
	> patched the fpsinfo.ww32.patch to build ww43 	
		fpsinfo.ww32.patch is already patched into the mainline, 
		/frameworks/av/media/libstagefright/AwesomePlayer.cpp
		change 	`static unsigned long g_log_level = 0;` to 	`static unsigned long g_log_level = LOG_LEVEL_2`
	> take fps on FFRD PR2 while run video playback case with 30fps media file and 60fps media file
	> finish the socwatch analysis report 
	

### VV BOARD PR2
	> measure powerbreakdown data with cases as below
		idle | video_playback_1080p | record_social_1080p | stream_chrome | stream_stock | preview
	> measure Wakeup/sec/core data with cases ildle | video_playback_1080p | record_social_1080p | stream_stock |stream_chrome
	> finish the socwatch analysis report 
	> finish the powerbreakdown analysis report

### AUTO VPNP TOOL
	> find the reason why wakeup/sec/core cannot be measured by socwatch tool [SOVLED && FIXED 2013-10-30] 
		*add "--max-detail" to command
	> change video_playback case player from com.intel.android.gallery3d to com.android.gallery3d

### MSIC
	> use ffmpeg cut the media file to 3 min or 4 min
		command :`ffmpeg -ss 00:00:00 -i inputMediaFile.mp4 -vcodec copy -acodec copy -t 00:03:00 outputMediaFile.mp4`
		outputMediaFile was check by mediainfo, Frame rate mode: Constant && Frame rate stay the same as inputMediaFile

### TO DO
	> [Gerrit] check the code and remove the needless space and tab which marked on the Gerrit server, and send email ask Richard to review the code when it was finished
	> [AUTO VPNP TOOL] intergrate FPS measurement into the AUTO VPNP TOOL
	> [AUTO VPNP TOOL] replace the media file with the ffmpeg cut media file
	> [AUTO VPNP TOOL] data analysis module develop
	> [STOCK BROWSER] try to find the reason why our FFRD-PR2 can not launch the stock browser while camera team's FFRD-PR2 do
