### WEEKLY WORK
	[FFRD-2]
		> Measure the power consumption, do the socwatch analyze report
		> [RECORD-1080P-FPS] The fps of the record file from record social 1080p case, drop to
			24.25fps only, while HaiQiang measure it with 29.868fps. Try to find the reason or
			solution.
			ADD: This issue is talk about on the weekly sync. and richard say it is affected by 
			the light. I did a simple experiment as below
				* run record_social_1080p case under shadow, fps = 16.638
				* run record_social_1080p case under light, fps = 29.97
			It is the reason
