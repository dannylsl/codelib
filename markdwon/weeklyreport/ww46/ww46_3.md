				* need to add new fps-taken case of stream and video playback 1080p 720p 60fps
				* It seems the VPP does not always take effect and we would better play the clip to the end

					Haiyang recommands to open the log output, rebuild and replace libs to check whether VPP works
		> Do the socwatch and powerbreakdown measurement and the analysis work
