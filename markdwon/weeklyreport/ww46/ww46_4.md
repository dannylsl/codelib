##WW46 SUMMARY
#####DATE:2013-11-21	AUTHOR: Shaoling

### TO DO PROGRESS
	> [WEEKLY WORK]
		> build new libs for ww46 [AwesomePlayer.cpp | SensorSevice.cpp]
			[STATE - DONE]
		> Measure the ww46 build power consumption on VV Board and FFRD-PR2
			[STATE - DONE]
				* need to add new fps-taken case of stream and video playback 1080p 720p 60fps
				* It seems the VPP does not always take effect and we would better play the clip to the end
					while measuring a video playback case
					Haiyang recommands to open the log output, rebuild and replace libs to check whether VPP works
		> Do the socwatch and powerbreakdown measurement and the analysis work
			[STATE - DONE]
				* SOCWATCH measurement and analysis work have been done on both VV BOARD and FFRD-PR2.
				* powerbreakdown case was ignored on VV BOARD since the Labview license issue 
				* new cases [ video_playback_720p_60fps_fps_stagefright | video_playback_1080p_60fps_fps_stagefright ] added
				* add video_playback_common_setup | video_playback_common_start | video_playback_common_stop shell-scripts
				* change the time when execute the dumpsys command to catch the correct dumpsys

	> [AUTO VPNP TOOL]
		[HEARTBEAT WITH CAMERA]
		[TASK-1] Optimize the image similarity comparsion
		[TASK-2] Design the basic GUI with python Tkinter module

### TRACKING
	* This weekly build [ww46] can not launch *STOCK BROWSER* on both VV BOARD and FFRD-PR2 with the 'Parameters Settings'	
		archieved on ww43 as below
		> VV BOARD [Power Tool Setting -> Parameters] 'Power-up current limit' > 5A && set the run-time current limit to maximum
		> FFRD-PR2 [Power Tool Setting -> Parameters] 'Power-up current limit' > 5A && keep others as default
	Have check with camera team
